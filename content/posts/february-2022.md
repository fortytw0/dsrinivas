## Change of plans

As you may see from my footer on this page, I am not actually using Django, Nginx or VueJS to generate this page. I am actually using Hugo + Netlify, and a beautiful theme by Athul named Archie. 

I spent over 2 months tweaking with my code before finding myself in the doldrums. It barely worked, and failed in the features that I wanted it to succeed, and worked as expected in features that I could not care for. 

Eventually of course, I gave up. My blog idea, I accepted, was over. 

## Sundays  

The thing about Sundays that I hate the most is the existential dread that fills me up when I look at the coursework I need to complete before the end of the day. I would do anything, anything at all - to not get embroiled in the avalanche of work that the day holds in store for me. 

So much so, that I actually built a functional blog, replete with the features that I need. 

I guess, thank you existential dread for completing this blog?

## Waste of time, or time waste?

2 months of effort, and I have nothing to show for - well not in code at least. 

This website took me less than 30 mins to setup. And it's waaaay better than what I conjured. 

I have some code from the previous project if you are interested, but I promise you it's not very interesting. Have these 2 months been in vain? I don't know, it feels like it. 

But also a part of me says that there was purpose to  my fidgeting, and the intentions that paved the way were made of good faith. 

## Failing to fail fast. 

This I think is the primary thing to take away - all good ideas can only consume so much time from my life. Learning to cut my losses and move on is an important distinction to make. 

### Until next dread filled Sunday, see you!
